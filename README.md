# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Welcome to my Titanic Machine Learning project!  
This project is based on the classic Kaggle competition: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, sex, and class.

## Approach 🧠

- Selected simple features: `Sex`, `Age`,`Relatives`, `Embarked`, `HighFare`
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Converted `Sex` to numeric values (male → 0, female → 1)
  - Filled missing `Age` values with median
  - Coverted `Embarked`, S=1, C=1 & Q=2
  - `HighFare` calculated median fare of each class and compare them (higer than median → 1, lower → 0)
  - Calculated the `Relatives` in ship by `ParCh` + `SibSp`
- Built and trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicted survival on the test set
- Created a Kaggle submission file



## Results 🎯

- **Validation Accuracy:** ~74.8%
- **Kaggle Public Leaderboard Score:** 0.77272



## How to Run 💻
1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lesa-hettiarachchi/Titanic-ML.git
   cd Titanic-ML
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```
3. Install required packages:

  	```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
5.	Execute the notebook cells to train the model and generate submission.csv
  
6.	Upload submission.csv to Kaggle for evaluation!



## Future Work 🚀

- Add more features (Deck from Cabin, Title)

- Handle missing data more intelligently

- Try different models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

- Apply cross-validation for better evaluation
